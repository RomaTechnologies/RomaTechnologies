CoWin Helper: Privacy policy

Welcome to the CoWin Helper app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Roma Technologies. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the you is stored on Firebase only, and can be simply erased by doing logout from app.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Roma Technologies.
